## HTML Cleaner Add-on for Anki

Cleans and minifies HTML content of the current field, removing extraneous tags and attributes copied over from apps like Word, Chrome, etc.

## Usage

The add-on comes with a button and two hotkeys:

- Clicking on the *cH* button in the editor will clean the HTML code of the active field. The same functionality can also be invoked via <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>
- Shift-clicking the button or combining the aforementioned hotkey with Shift will undo the changes to the current field. (Anki's inbuilt undo functionality does not work with the add-on. This is a limitation that can't be solved trivially, I'm afraid.)
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> will clean the clipboard selection and paste the processed text into the current field

## Configuration

The add-on's HTML processing is highly configurable. All options can be accessed by editing the configuration section of `html_cleaner/main.py`.
